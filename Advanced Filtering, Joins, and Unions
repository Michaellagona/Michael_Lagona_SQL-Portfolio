Risk Analysis by Branch Markets
We are analyzing their risk level at branches in the Atlanta, GA market to see if it equates to the 
same risk level as online signups as there has been a large increase in defaults in this market.
Can you provide the Director of Internal Risk with applicants that signed up at an actual branch location
in this market who are subprime, along with their names, city, state, email address, and credit score?
It’s OK if the applicant doesn’t reside in Atlanta, GA. Their focus is the branch locations.*/
